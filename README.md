# smartystreetsapi

I was testing out the smarty streets api when I realized the google geocode api will fit my needs just as well and I
have more experience in it so in the interest of time I used that API for the project.

I may take another look at this api if I need to do type ahead for address's
Or if I just have a bit of time, it's pretty fun to use.
